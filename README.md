# SpO2-prediction-
This project predicts the blood oxygen saturation level (SpO₂) using machine learning. It uses patient vital signs, fall detection, and alert indicators as inputs. Multiple regression models are trained and the best one is selected using the R² score. The final model is deployed using a Streamlit web application for real-time prediction.
